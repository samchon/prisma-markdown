/// Customer information, but not a person but a **connection** basis.
///
/// `drive_customers` is an entity that literally embodies the information 
/// of those who participated in the drive system as customers. By the way, 
/// the `drive_customers` does not mean a person, but a **connection** basis.
/// Therefore, even if the same person connects to the drive system multiple,
/// multiple records are created in `drive_customers`.
/// 
/// The first purpose of this is to track the customer's inflow path in detail, 
/// and it is for cases where the same person enters as a non-member, reads a 
/// {@link drive_repository_files repository file} in advance, and registers/logs 
/// in at the moment for modification. It is the second. Lastly, it is to 
/// accurately track the activities that a person performs at the drive system 
/// in various ways like below.
///
/// - Same person comes from an {@link drive_external_users external service}
/// - Same person creates multiple {@link drive_members accounts}
/// - Same person makes a download with only {@link drive_citizens real name authentication}
/// 
/// Therefore, `drive_customers` can have multiple records with the same 
/// {@link drive_citizens}, {@link drive_members}, and {@link drive_external_users}. 
/// Additionally, if a customer signs up for membership after verifying their real 
/// name or signs up for our service after being a user of an external service, 
/// all related records are changed at once. Therefore, identification and tracking 
/// of customers can be done very systematically.
